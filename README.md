# AuditX

Hey guys glad to see yall here. 
Hope you guys like what we are building here.
Alwaays feel free to ask me any questions related to this project. 

About me 
I actually am a web2 dev who has been working in the Risk dept of a Fintech company building AI algorithms to reduce risk while doing credit checks.
I have been coding most of my life with mutiple projects under my portfolio.
My idea with this project was what can I do in the web3 space with my experience in dealing with Risk. So here I am developing a AI Auditor to Audit web3 contracts which ultimately mitigates risk by making sure the contract does not have any loopholes or unforseen entry points. 

Anyways thanks guys do let me know if you have any questions regarding AuditX.
